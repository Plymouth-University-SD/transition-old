Transition
==========

Rails app for managing the transition of websites to GOV.UK

The script `load.sh` loads configuration data from the [redirector](http://github.com/alphagov/redirector) and imports statistical data from [transition-stats](http://github.com/alphagov/transition-stats) which are checked out into the `data` directory.
