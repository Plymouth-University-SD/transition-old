Transition
==========

Rails app for managing the transition of websites to plymouth.ac.uk

The script `load.sh` loads configuration data from submodule [redirector](http://github.com/alphagov/redirector) and imports statistical data from submodule [transition-stats](http://github.com/alphagov/transition-stats), both of which live in the `data` directory.

All new shiny!
